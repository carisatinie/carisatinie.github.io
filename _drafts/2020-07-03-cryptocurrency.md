Ledger (contains all the payments being made)needs trust for it to work

Each person has public and private key

Signature = Sign(Message, private key)
Verify(Message, Signature, public key) = True/False
Is this signature signed with the private key associated with this public key?
256 bit signature makes it hard to guess -- could only produce if they knew the private key associated with the public key

Each transaction also has a unique ID associated with it, to prevent duplication of the entire message + signature
so the signature of each transaction will be different, even if itâ€™s duplicated

Disconnect ledger from real world cash
Prevent spending on the ledger more than the person is carrying

Bitcoin = ledger: history of transactions
